The world trade organization (WTO) legally regulates the world trade system with its dispute settlement body (DSB).
While there exists a shared understanding among legal experts about how articles of WTO agreements interact with each other,
the complexity in these agreement-level networks has greatly constrained scholars as well as practitioners with limited legal resources from fully understanding the dispute settlement mechanisms. 
To address this issue, I propose a new method that effectively summarizes the systematic interactions between articles of WTO agreements.
I collect past 20 years of WTO disputes and train a neural network that mimics the reasoning process of legal experts that determines which articles to cite for given factual description of the dispute.
I then investigate all the predictions from the trained neural network and fit the summarization network using Random Forest.
Finally, I verify the quality of the fitted network %by checking that the network captures the important systematic interactions as explained by the Panel and Appellate Body, two main judicial authorities of the WTO DSB.  %with its own l.%, Panel and Appellate Body. 
% I find 
by finding three major clusters from the network along three core principles of WTO DSB: Market Access, Reciprocity, and Non-discrimination.

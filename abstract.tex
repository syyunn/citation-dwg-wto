The world trade organization (WTO) legally regulates the world trade system with its dispute settlement body (DSB).
There exists a shared understanding among legal experts about how articles of WTO agreements systematically interact with each other. 
% Those understanding has been exclusively shared among the group of experts. 
However, the complexity of the WTO legal framework has constrained many developing countries with limited legal knowledge and resources from fully utilizing the WTO DSB.
To address this issue, I propose a new method that summarizes the systematic interactions between articles of WTO agreements.
I collected past 20 years of WTO disputes and trained a neural network that mimics the reasoning process of legal experts that determines which articles to cite for given factual description of the dispute.
Then I collected all the predictions from the trained neural network and fitted the summarization network using Random Forest.
I verified the quality of the fitted network by checking that the network captures the important systematic interactions as explained by the Panel and Appellate Body, two main judicial authorities of the WTO DSB.  %with its own l.%, Panel and Appellate Body. 
% The pattern of interactions are shown as explained in the Panel and Appellate Body reports of the WTO DSB.

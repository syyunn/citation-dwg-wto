The world trade organization (WTO) legally regulates the world trade system with its dispute settlement body (DSB). While there exists a shared understanding among legal experts about how articles of WTO agreements interact with each other, the complexity in these agreement-level networks has greatly constrained scholars as well as practitioners with limited legal resources from fully understanding the dispute settlement mechanisms.  To address this issue, I propose a new method that effectively summarizes the systematic interactions between articles of WTO agreements. I collect the past 20 years of WTO disputes and train a neural network that mimics the reasoning process of legal experts that determines which articles to cite for a given factual description of the dispute.
I then investigate all the predictions from the trained neural network and fit the summarization network using Random Forest.
Finally, I verify the quality of the fitted network by finding three major clusters from the fitted network along with three core principles of WTO DSB: Market Access, Reciprocity, and Non-discrimination.

The world trade organiztion (WTO) legally regulates the world trade system with its dispute settlement body (DSB).
There exists an shared understanding among legal experts about how articles of WTO agreements interact with each other, however, 
those understanding has been exclusively shared inside the group of experts.  %because it was hard to be materialized.
This exclusiveness has widen the gap
between the developing and developed countries in terms of
legal capacity and deteriorated the effectiveness of WTO DSB.
To address this issue, I propose a new method that materializes the relationship between articles of WTO agreements. %in a form of directed edge weight of the network.
I collected past 20 years of WTO disputes and trained a neural network that mimics the reasoning process of legal experts that determines which articles to cite for given factual circumstances of legal dispute.
Then I collected all the predictions from the trained neural network and fitted a network of articles using Random Forest.
I found that this fitted network captures the important interactions between articles as closely to that of authoritative jurisprudences of WTO DSB.

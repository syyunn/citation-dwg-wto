The world trade organization (WTO) legally regulates the world trade system with its dispute settlement body (DSB).
There exists a shared understanding among legal experts about how articles of WTO agreements interact with each other. Those understanding has been exclusively shared inside the group of experts. 
However, the complexity of the WTO legal framework has constrained many developing countries with limited legal knowledge and resources from fully utilizing the WTO DSB.
To address this issue, I propose a new method that materializes the relationship between articles of WTO agreements.
I collected past 20 years of WTO disputes and trained a neural network that mimics the reasoning process of legal experts that determines which articles to cite for given factual circumstances of legal dispute.
Then I collected all the predictions from the trained neural network and fitted a network of articles using Random Forest.
I found that this fitted network captures the important interactions between articles closely to the authoritative jurisprudences of WTO DSB. 
The pattern of interactions are shown as explained in the Panel and Appellate Body reports of the WTO DSB.

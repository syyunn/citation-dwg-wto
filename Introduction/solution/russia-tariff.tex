    ``The dictionary definition of the noun `excess' is `the amount by which one number
        or quantity exceeds another'. More specifically, `in excess of' means `more than'. Thus,
        as a textual matter, a particular number or quantity is `in excess of' another number
        or quantity if it is greater, regardless of the extent to which it is greater. 
      \textbf{\textit{Looking at the context of Article II:1(b), first sentence, we note that Article III:2, first
      sentence, of the GATT 1994 is cast in very similar terms and in fact uses the phrase
      `in excess of'}}:\\

      territory of any other contracting party shall not be subject … to internal
      taxes or other internal charges of any kind in excess of those applied … to
      like domestic products \ldots}

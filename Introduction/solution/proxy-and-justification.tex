To address this issue, 
this paper maps 
the regulatory system of WTO DSB 
with a network of legal articles 
of the WTO agreement (Figure \ref{fig:market-aceess}). 
This is because rules of the WTO agreement
\footnote{\textit{See} Article 7 in Dispute Settlement Rules: Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, Annex 2, 1869 U.N.T.S. 401, 33 I.L.M. 1226 (1994)} 
explicitly requires judicial bodies to address
relevant articles to construct its jurisprudence.
In addition to it, judicial bodies tend to combine 
multiple articles of the WTO agreement 
to identify the legal characteristics of the trade policy 
and to clarify the interpretation of specific text 
appearing in the articles of the WTO agreement 
\citep{oesch2003standards}.

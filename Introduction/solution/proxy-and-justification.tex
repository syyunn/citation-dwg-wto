To address this issue,
this paper maps
the regulatory system of WTO DSB
as a network of legal articles
of the WTO agreements as formally defined in Figure \ref{fig:def} and exemplified in the Figure\ref{fig:market-aceess_directed}. This is because rules of the WTO agreements
% \footnote{\textit{See} Article 7 in Dispute Settlement Rules: Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, Annex 2, 1869 U.N.T.S. 401, 33 I.L.M. 1226 (1994)} 
explicitly requires judicial bodies to address
relevant articles together to construct its jurisprudence as shown in Figure \ref{fig:art7dsu}.
Upon this requirement, judicial bodies refer to
multiple articles of the WTO agreements together
to identify the complex legal identity of the trade policy that led to the dispute.
In addition to it, judicial bodies cite multiple articles together
to provide an authoritative interpretation of the rules of the WTO agreements
\citep{oesch2003standards}.

    \[ \textit{directed weighted graph }G = (V, E, w) \]

    \[\vec{E} = \{(v_i, v_j) \mid (v_i, v_j)\in V \times V)\} \] %\text{ and } \]
    \[w : V \times V \to \Bbb R_{+} \text{ } s.t. \sum_{v_j\in V}{w(v_i, v_j)} = 1 \text{ } \forall v_i \in V \text{ and }\]

        This figure demonstrates a network of articles of WTO agreements
        that cooperatively achieves \textit{Market access} principle of WTO.
        Tariff and Non-tariff barriers such as quantitative restriction, internal taxations

        Therefore, these articles tend to work together to ensure the \textit{Market access} principle working properly.

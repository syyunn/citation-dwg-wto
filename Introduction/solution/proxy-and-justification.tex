To address this issue, 
this paper maps 
the regulatory system of WTO DSB 
as a network of legal articles 
of the WTO agreements as exemplified in the Figure \ref{fig:market-aceess_directed} 
and formally defined in Figure \ref{fig:def}. This is because rules of the WTO agreements
% \footnote{\textit{See} Article 7 in Dispute Settlement Rules: Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, Annex 2, 1869 U.N.T.S. 401, 33 I.L.M. 1226 (1994)} 
explicitly requires judicial bodies to address 
relevant articles together to construct its jurisprudence (Figure \ref{fig:art7dsu}).
Upon this requirement, judicial bodies refer to 
multiple articles of the WTO agreements together
to identify the complex legal identity of the trade policy that led to the dispute.
In addition to it, judicial bodies cite multiple articles together 
to provide an authoritative interpretation of the rules of the WTO agreements
\citep{oesch2003standards}.

\[\text{Network of legal articles of WTO agreement is defined as }  G = (V, E, w) \] 
\[\text{ where } V = \{v \mid v\text{ is a legal article of WTO agreement}\}  \text{ , } \]
\[\vec{E} = \{(v_1, v_2) \mid (v_1, v_2)\in V \times V)\} \text{ and }w : V \times V \to \Bbb R_{+} \]
\[G\text{ is simply called \textit{directed weighted graph}}\]

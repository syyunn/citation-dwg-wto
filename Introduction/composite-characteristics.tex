A lawsuit tends to cite multiple rules of the WTO agreement because one simple rule can't cover the complex characteristics of the trade policy that led to the dispute \citep{palmeter2004dispute}.
For example, the United States enacted \textit{Continued Dumping and Subsidy Act of 2000} (CDSOA) that distributes
the collected anti-dumping duties to its affected domestic producers. 
This act was challenged by other members with multiple rules of 
the WTO agreements such as rules of \textit{Anti-dumping} and \textit{Subsidy} because
this distribution could constitute an illegal subsidy prohibited
in the rules of the WTO agreements in addition to the breach of the rules of the anti-dumping. %\citep{cdsoa}.

Citation of the rules of the WTO agreements tends to get more complicated since members cite the
rules of the WTO agreements strategically. For example,
members cite different rules of the WTO agreements to limit or to encourage
the third party participation to the case. Since the third party participation
can lead to early settlement of the dispute without continuous
legal battle, members cite differntly according to their intention to 
settle the case out of court or vice versa. 
\citep{who_gets}.

In addition to it, citation tends to get complicated
if we consider the fact WTO DSB defers to legal precedents.
Legal precedents refer to its own judicial decisions
and these precedents provide authoritative reference
for deciding subsequent identical or similar cases.
Members try to reshape these legal precedents
in favor of their future interest rather than
simply using the WTO DSB to resolve their specific trade
dispute \citep{pelc}. For example,
members cite their
favorable previous cases more often in specific
trade issue areas where they face ligitagion more frequently with other members.

This process requires enormous legal knowledge and resources because the legal system of WTO is highly complex.
This complexity has constrained many developing countries with limited legal knowledge and resources from fully utilizing the WTO DSB
\citep{busch_reinhardt_shaffer_2009, dev_busch, shaffer_2006}. 
 
To address this issue, I provide a novel method to summarize the network of WTO articles.
Currently, understanding of how articles of WTO agreements systematically interact with each other is exclusively shared among legal experts.
However, by developing the method that can quantitatively summarize the systematic interaction between articles of WTO,
we can lower the cost of understanding the legal system of WTO. This will help resolve the unbalanced legal capacity issue in WTO DSB.
 
To properly summarize the systematic interactions between articles of WTO agreements, I designed my method based on two following considerations.
First, since the legal system of WTO evolves from the way how real-world dispute interacts with the regulatory content of the article of WTO agreement,
I considered a way of utilizing two different types of textual data, factual description of the trade dispute and the content of each article of the WTO agreements.
Second, since members strategically cite rules of the WTO agreements to encourage
the third party participation \citep{who_gets} or to reshape the legal precedents\citep{pelc, latent},
I considered a way of generalizing these member-specific strategic citations.
 
Upon these two considerations, this paper uses deep learning.
Deep learning is empirically known as good at extracting information from the textual data.
In addition to it, deep learning also generalizes the patterns inside data.
Therefore, this paper designs a deep neural network that
processes two different types of textual data,
description of the dispute and each article content of the WTO agreements.
The design mimics the reasoning process of the legal experts,
where the experts read
the textual description of the dispute and imagine applicable legal articles of the WTO agreements according to its regulatory content.
 
To train this neural network, I collected textual description of trade dispute and articles of the WTO agreement cited for each dispute requested to the WTO DSB
from 1995 to 2018.
Using this collected data, I trained the neural network by enforcing the neural network to answer correctly
whether a given article of the WTO agreements
can be cited for the given textual description of
trade dispute.
After training, I fitted a network that summarizes the systematic interactions between articles of WTO agreements using \textit{Random Forests} \citep{rf, genie3}.
The network is fitted as to best explain the variance of each article's citabilities. Those citabilities are collected from the predictions of the trained deep neural network.
 
To verify the quality of the fitted network, I compared the fitted network with the jurisprudence of WTO DSB appearing in the Panel and Appellate Body reports.
Specifically, I found three major principles of WTO DSB, \textit{Market Access}, \textit{Reciprocity}, and \textit{Non-discrimination}, are clustered in the fitted network.
The systematic interactions between articles of WTO agreements are formed as how the Panel and Appellate Body explained in their judicial opinions.
As Panel and Appellate Body authoritatively constitute the jurisprudence of WTO DSB, one can conclude that the method qualitatively summarizes the systematic interactions of articles of WTO agreements.

\section{Modeling and Formal Definitions}
\subsection{Network of Articles of the WTO agreements \label{subsec:def}}

I define the network of articles of WTO agreements as directed weighted graph $G=(V, \vec{E}, W)$ which is comprised of 
vertex set $V$, set of directed edges $\vec{E}$, and edge weight matrix $W$. I define each legal article of WTO agreement as a vertex, thus
$V=\{v \mid v\text{ is a legal article of WTO agreement\}}$. Then I define all ordered pairs of vertices as a set of directed edges $\vec{E}$, thus
$\vec{E} = \{(v_i, v_j) \mid (v_i, v_j)\in V \times V)\}$. 
Finally, I define the edge weight matrix $W=(w(v_i, v_j)) \in [0,1]^{|V| \times |V|}$ where all incoming edge weights sum up to $1$ for all given target vertex $v_j$, thus
$\sum_{v_i\in V}{w(v_i, v_j)}$ = 1. $w$ denotes a map that assigns a weight for each ordered pair of vertices, thus $w : V \times V \to [0,1]$. 
I always assign weight $0$ for the directed edge comprised of the same vertex, thus  $w(v_i, v_i) = 0 \:\: \forall{v_i \in V}$.
For convenience, I define $w_{ij} = w(v_i, v_j)$.


\subsection{Modeling Interaction between Articles of WTO agreements as Conditional Probability}
I interpret every directed edge weight $w(v_i, v_j)$ as the conditional probability $P(v_j|v_i) \in [0,1]$, where the probability represents how probably the source node $v_i$ clarifies the interpretation of the target node $v_j$ comapred to all other source nodes $v\in V \setminus \{v_i, v_{j}\}$. 
The articles of WTO agreements interdependently constitute the legal context to clarify the interpretation of other articles as shown in the the Panel report of \textit{Russia-Tariff Treatment} case, as excerpted in Figure \ref{subfig:a:condprob}. In \textit{Russia-Tariff Treatment} case, the Panel explained that Article II:1(b) clarifies the meaning of the same phrase \textit{`in excess of'} in Article III:2.
By modeling this clarification relationship as the directed edge weight $w_{ij}$, I let the edge weight $w_{ij}$ represent the realtive importance of a source article $v_i$ clarifying the interpretation of the target article $v_j$. I illustrated this relationship in Figure \ref{subfig:a:art2b}.

\subsection{Methodological Objective: Finding $G^*$}
I aim to find $G^* = (V, \vec{E}, W^*)$ where the $W^*$ closely reflect the clarification relationship between articles of WTO agreements as explained by the authoritative judicial bodies of the WTO DSB, Panel and Appellate Body. To find $W^*$, this paper collected the past 20 years of legal dispute data in WTO DSB. The types and composition of the data collected will be explained in Section \ref{sec:data}.
Then I design a deep neural network to encode the pattern of interactions of the articles of WTO agreements found in the data. Justification of using deep learning, design and training of deep neural network, and fitting process of $W^*$ using \textit{Random Forest} will be explained in Section \ref{sec:methods}.
Finally in Section \ref{ef}, I will verify the quality of the fitted $G^*$ by comparing the systematic interaction between articles of WTO agreements found in $G^*$ with the corresponding jurisprudence of the Panel and Appellate Body.

% network $G = (V, \vec{E}, W)$ collect all the relative importance of each article compared to other articles to

% model this clarification relationship as the directed edge weight $w(v_i, v_j)$.

% Above subfigure (a) represents how jurisprudence of \textit{Panel} stated in (b) is represented as an edge weight where the source node Article II:1(b) constitutes the legal context of the target node Article III:2 regarding how to interpret its term \textit{`in excess of'} with the $8\%$ of importance compared to other possible source articles.}

% The system has become more complex as the number of cases requested to WTO DSB increases and developing countries can't resolve their dissatisfaction over the trade relationship in WTO DSB.

% Moreover, I aim to summarize the network of WTO articles as a whole not by parts.
% There already exists numerous literatures that studied the relationship between articles of WTO agreements \citep{chadXXIII, charnovitz, Trachtman, who_gets}.
% However, previous literatures have been limited to studying the interconnections between relatively small number of articles, which are mostly less than 10. % and has not been conducted in a level of entire WTO agreements. As my method captures the entire systematic correlation between the articles of WTO agreements, it becomes 
% By pursuing a holistic approach, I intend to enhance the practicalness of the method. The legal system of WTO always works as whole and the entire system provide legal contexts to its sub-systems \citep{system_as_a_whole}.

% In other words, this method effectively materializes the shared understanding of legal experts thus can lower the cost to build the same amount of legal capacity to understand the WTO DSB.
% Moreover, rather than keep relying on previous approach that provides legal advice to developing countries that does not create a shared understanding over the system between developing and developed countries,

% way of the fitted network $G^*$ explaining how articles of WTO agreements achieve some main principles of WTO, such as \textit{Market Access}, \textit{Reciprocity} and \textit{Non-discrimination}



% fitted a set of directed edge weights $W^*$ that
% best explains the variance of each article's citabilities that are predicted by the trained deep neural network using a machine learning technique \textit{Random Forests} \citep{rf, genie3}.
 
% After fitting $W^*$, to check whether this fitted network of articles of the WTO agreements\\  $G^*$ = ($V$, $E$, $W^*$) maps the jurisprudences of WTO DSB properly, this paper
% compares the way of the fitted network $G^*$ explaining how articles of WTO agreements achieve some main principles of WTO, such as \textit{Market Access}, \textit{Reciprocity} and \textit{Non-discrimination}
% with the jurisprudences of \textit{Panel} and \textit{Appellate Body}. This comparison reveals that the fitted network $G^*$ captures the interactions between the articles of WTO agreements
% closely to the jurisprudences of \textit{Panel} and \textit{the Appellate Body}. We can infer from this similarity that the fitted network $G^*$ closely maps the jurisprudences of WTO DSB. This is because those two judicial bodies
% authoritatively constitute the jurisprudences over how rules of WTO agreements are working together
% to achieve those main principles.
 
% Finally, upon this similarity, this paper offers this methodology as
% an alternative solution to the widening gap of legal capacity between developing and developed countries in WTO DSB.
% Since this method effectively materializes the shared understanding of legal experts and reveals important interactions between articles inside the system of WTO DSB,
% it can lower the cost to build the same amount of legal capacity to understand the WTO DSB.
% Moreover, rather than keep relying on previous approach that provides legal advice to developing countries that does not create a shared understanding over the system between developing and developed countries,
% if we shift our focus on how to materialize the current shape of the system, WTO
% will become more effective as members being able to discuss their trade issues upon the measurable ground of shared understanding about how WTO works.
 



% Therefore, this paper designs a deep neural network (\textit{See} Figure \ref{fig:design-of-nn} and \ref{fig:dnn-flow}) that
% processes two different types of textual information.
% One is textual description of the dispute (\textit{See} an example at \hyperref[sub:factual-aspect-example]{Appendix A.1}) and

% To develop a proper method that can find a set of directed edge weights $W$ defined in Figure \ref{fig:def}

% Second, one need to generalize the members' strategic citation pattern that is limited to a member-specific political interest.
% For example, members strategically cite different rules of the WTO agreements to limit or to encourage
% the third party participation. Since the third party participation
% can lead to early settlement of the dispute without continuous
% legal battle, members cite differently according to their intention to
% settle the case earlier out of court \citep{who_gets}. Moreover, members cite articles strategically trying to reshape the legal precedents of WTO DSB

A lawsuit tends to cite multiple rules of the WTO agreement because one simple rule can't cover the complex characteristics of the trade policy that led to the dispute \citep{palmeter2004dispute}.
For example, the United States enacted \textit{Continued Dumping and Subsidy Act of 2000} (CDSOA) that distributes
the collected anti-dumping duties to its affected domestic producers.
This act was challenged by other members with multiple rules of
the WTO agreements such as \textit{rules of anti-dumping} and \textit{rules of subsidy} because
this distribution could constitute an illegal subsidy and anti-dumping duty at the same time (\textit{See} Figure \ref{fig:complex-measure}).

Citation of articles of the WTO agreements are evidence of how WTO rules are applied in the real world. 
For example, WTO sets \textit{Market Acceess} as one of its main principles to smooth the world  trade flow
and this principle is achieved through cooperation between multile articles of the WTO agreements (\textit{See} Figure \ref{fig:market-aceess_directed}).
Therefore, analyzing how rules of the WTO agreements are interconnected provide us a clear view how WTO DSB constitutes specific norm or regulates specific trade issues. 
This kind of study has been actively pursued by a group of researchers, such as Chad P. Bown, Pelc, etc. However, those efforts has been limited to 
study interconnectedness between relatively small number (2 - 3) of articles of the WTO agreements and has not been conducted in a level of entire WTO agreements.
There exists a shared understanding about how rules of the WTO agreements are interconnected as a whole, however, this entire map of understanding is exclusively shared among a group of legal experts of the WTO agreements.
This exclusiveness keep becoming more severe as the jurisprudence of the WTO DSB evolves and this leads to a widening gap of legal capcity between developing and developed countries in WTO. 
This gap inhibits the effectiveness of the WTO at this moment and members are discussing possible solutions under the agenda of \textit{WTO reform} 
but proposed solutions are mainly about unilateral support of legal resources from the developed countries to developing countries and this solution has been ineffectiveness reflecting on the similar efforts during the past decades of WTO DSB.

Therefore, this paper addresses importane of revolutionize the way of studying network of articles of WTO agreements in a more scaled way and propose a new methodology to
materialize the relationship between the articles of the WTO agreements. 
For this paper, this paper maps
the regulatory system of WTO DSB
as a network of legal articles
of the WTO agreements as formally defined in Figure \ref{fig:def} and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:def-example}. This is because the rules of the WTO agreements
explicitly requires \textit{Panel} or \textit{Appellate Body} to address
relevant articles together when they construct its jurisprudence related to the meaning, scope and interpretation of any legal text in the WTO agreements (\textit{See} Figure \ref{fig:art7dsu}).
Upon this requirement, judicial bodies refer to
multiple articles of the WTO agreements together
to identify the complex legal identity of the trade policy that led to the dispute as shown in Figure \ref{fig:complex-measure}.
In addition to it, judicial bodies cite multiple articles together
to guide an way of interpretation of the rules of the WTO agreements (\textit{See} Figure \ref{subfig:a:condprob})

To develop a proper method that can find a set of directed edge weights $W$ (Figure \ref{fig:def}) 
as close to a shared understanding of legal experts, this paper points out two main considerations. 
First, one need to use information inside a textual description of factual circumnstances of the dispute and reuglatory contents described in article of the WTO agreements.
Second, one need to generalize the members' strategic citation pattern that is limited to each members' specific political interest.
For example,
members cite different rules of the WTO agreements to limit or to encourage
the third party participation to the case. Since the third party participation
can lead to early settlement of the dispute without continuous
legal battle, members strategically cite different rules of WTO agreements according to their intention to
settle the case earlier out of court or vice versa \citep{who_gets}. 

Upon these two considerations, this paper adopts a deep neural network as a technical soultion.
because a deep neural network generally known as good at effectively extracting information from text data and generalizing the patterns inside data. 
This paper designs a deep neural network (Figure \ref{fig:traditional-convolutional-network}) that
processes two different types of textual information.
One is textual description of the dispute (\textit{See} an example at \hyperref[sub:factual-aspect-example]{Appendix A.1}) and
the other one is the text of a legal article of the WTO agreements (\textit{See} an example at Figure \ref{fig:gatt_art1}).
This design is improvised to mimic
the reasoning process of WTO legal practitioners
where the legal practitioners read
the textual description of
factual circumstances of the dispute and imagine applicable regulatory contents of
the legal articles while he/she reads the factual description (\textit{See} \ref{fig:viz:how-member-cites-citable}, \ref{fig:viz:how-member-cites-non-citable} and \ref{fig:design-of-nn}).

% As WTO sets its main principles to regulate the world trade system in general
% such as principle of \textit{Market Acceess} (across borders), 
% \textit{Non-discrimination} (between members 
% or between domestic products and imported products) 
% and \textit{Transparency} (in publication and maintaining

% Moeroever, members' citation of articles of the WTO agreements also gets complicated
% if we consider the fact that \textit{Panel} or \textit{Appellate Body} defers to the legal precedents of WTO DSB.
% Legal precedents refer to \textit{Panel} or \textit{Appellate Body}'s judicial decisions

The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with trade disputes between WTO members.
WTO members can file a lawsuit in the DSB to blame possible illegal action of the other member's trade policy.
Then a judicial body, called ``Panel'', adjudicates the dispute between members and submits a report in which it expresses
its conclusion as to whether the challenged trade policy is inconsistent to the rules of the WTO or not \citep{world2017handbook}.

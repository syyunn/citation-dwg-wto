The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) deals
with trade disputes between WTO members.
WTO members file a lawsuit in WTO DSB to
claim their impaired benefit related to the WTO agreements as a result of another member's possible illegal trade policy.
The judicial body of WTO DSB, \textit{Panel} or \textit{Appellate Body}, then adjudicates the dispute and submits a report in which it expresses
its judicial opinion as to whether the challenged
trade policy is inconsistent to the rules of the WTO or not \citep{world2017handbook}.

The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) deals 
with trade disputes between WTO members.
WTO members can file a lawsuit in the DSB to 
claim their impaired benifit related to the WTO agreement as a result of possible illegal action of the other member's trade policy.
Then a judicial body, ``Panel'' or ``Appellate Body'', 
adjudicates the dispute and submits a report in which it expresses
its conclusion as to whether the challenged 
trade policy is inconsistent to the rules of the WTO or not \citep{world2017handbook}.

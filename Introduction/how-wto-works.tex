The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) deals 
with trade disputes between WTO members.
WTO members file a lawsuit in WTO DSB to 
claim their impaired benifit related to the WTO agreements as a result of possible illegal action of another member's trade policy.
Then a judicial body of WTO DSB, \textit{Panel} or \textit{Appellate Body}, %``Panel'' or ``Appellate Body'', 
adjudicates the dispute and submits a report in which it expresses
its judicial opinion as to whether the challenged 
trade policy is inconsistent to the rules of the WTO or not \citep{world2017handbook}.

A lawsuit tends to involve complex legal citation because a trade policy is usually pretty much complicated 
and hard to be covered by only one rule of the WTO agreement.
For example, the United States enacted \textit{Continued Dumping and Subsidy Act of 2000} that distributes 
the collected anti-dumping duties to its affected domestic producers and this act was challenged with multiple rules of the WTO agreement, 
such as \textit{Anti-dumping}, \textit{Subsidy} and \textit{Publication and Administration of Trade Regulations} and so on.

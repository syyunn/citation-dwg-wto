A lawsuit tends to cite multiple rules of the WTO agreement because a trade policy is usually pretty much complicated 
and one simple rule can't cover the characteristic of the trade policy at issue.
For example, the United States enacted \textit{Continued Dumping and Subsidy Act of 2000 (Byrd Amendment)} that distributes 
the collected anti-dumping duties to its affected domestic producers and this act was challenged with multiple rules of the WTO agreement, 
such as \textit{Anti-dumping}, \textit{Subsidy} and \textit{Publication and Administration of Trade Regulations} and so on.

Things are getting more interested if we consider the fact WTO DSB defers to legal precedents to increase the predictability of its own judicial decisions where
the legal precedent comprises previous decisions of WTO DSB. 
Members are trying to reshape this legal precedents in favor of their future interest rather than naively using the WTO DSB just 
to resolve their trade dispute with other member \citep{pelc}. 
For example, members try to cite their favorable previous cases more often in specific issue areas where
they face ligitagion more frequently \citep{latent} and keep reshaping the legal precedent as favoralbe as possible to their own interest.

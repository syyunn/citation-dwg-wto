% As WTO sets its main principles to regulate the world trade system in general
% such as principle of \textit{Market Acceess} (across borders), 
% \textit{Non-discrimination} (between members 
% or between domestic products and imported products) 
% and \textit{Transparency} (in publication and maintaining 
% of each member's internal regulations), 
% it's intellectually intriguing 
% to understand how regulatory system of WTO DSB
% is structured to achieve these main principles (\textit{See} Figure \ref{fig:market-aceess_directed}).
% By understanding this structure, 
% we can improve WTO system to serve its main prinicples more effectively 
% and to adopt to constantly
% changing world trade circumstances

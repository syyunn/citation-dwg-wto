As WTO sets multiple principles to regulate the world trade system, 
such as \textit{Market Acceess} (across borders), 
\textit{Non-discrimination} (between members 
or between domestic products and imported products) 
and \textit{Transparency} (in publication and maintaining 
of each member's internal regulations), 
it's intellectually intriguing 
to understand how regulatory system of WTO DSB
is structured to achieve these main principles of WTO.
By understanding this complex structure of WTO legal system, 
we can improve WTO system more efficiently 
to adopt to constantly 
changing world trade circumstances
\citep{FREDEBEULKREIN1999625, shaffer_2004, 10.1093/jiel/jgm028}.
However, it is extremely difficult to 
understand how rules of the WTO agreements are
working together to achieve those main principles of WTO. 
This is because each citation is closely related 
to multiple characteristics 
of each trade policy as exemplified in 
the above mentioned \textit{US - Offset (Byrd Amendment)} case. 
Moreover, to understand this co-working pattern between the rules of WTO agreements properly, 
it requires to generalize strategic 
citation patterns which are limited 
to each member's special interest 
rather than explaining the 
regulatory system of WTO DSB in general.

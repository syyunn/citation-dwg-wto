As WTO sets multiple principles to regulate the world trade system, 
such as \textit{Market Acceess} (across borders), 
\textit{Non-discrimination} (between members 
or between domestic products and imported products) 
and \textit{Transparency} (in publication and maintaining 
of each member's internal regulations), 
it's intellectually intriguing 
to understand how regulatory power of WTO
is structured to achieve these core principles.
By understanding this structural origin of the regulatory power, 
we can reform WTO to more effectively regulate 
the world trade system 
\citep{FREDEBEULKREIN1999625, shaffer_2004, 10.1093/jiel/jgm028}.

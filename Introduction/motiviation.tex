As WTO sets multiple principles to regulate the world trade system, 
such as \textit{Market Acceess} (across borders), 
\textit{Non-discrimination} (between members 
or between domestic products and imported products) 
and \textit{Transparency} (in publication and maintaining 
of each member's internal regulations), 
it's intellectually intriguing 
to understand how regulatory system of WTO DSB
is structured to achieve these core principles.
By understanding this structure, 
we can improve WTO system more efficiently 
to adopt to constantly 
changing world trade circumstances

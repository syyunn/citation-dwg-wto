However, it is extremely difficult to 
visually map how regulatory power of 
WTO DSB is organized to acheive 
those core principles. 
As explained above, 
this is because each citation is closely related 
to composite characteristics 
of each trade policy and also 
it requires to generalize those strategic 
citations which are limited 
to each member's special interest 
rather than explaining the 
regulatory power of WTO DSB in general.

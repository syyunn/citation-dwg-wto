However, it is extremely difficult to 
map how regulatory system of 
WTO DSB is organized to acheive 
those core principles. 
This is because each citation is closely related 
to composite characteristics 
of each trade policy as exemplified in 
the \textit{Byrd Amendment} above. 
Moreover, to map the system properly, 
it also requires to generalize above mentioned strategic 
citation patterns which are limited 
to each member's special interest 
rather than explaining the 
regulatory system of WTO DSB in general.

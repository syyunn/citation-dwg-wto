However, it is extremely difficult to map how regulatory network of 
WTO DSB is organized to acheive the core principles of WTO.

each citation is closely related 
to the composite characteristics of each trade policy 
as explained in the above example, \textit{Byrd Amendment}. 
Moreover, one needs to generalize the above mentioned strategic 
citation in WTO DSB which is limited to each member's 
specific political interest rather than explaining the 
regulatory power of WTO DSB in general.

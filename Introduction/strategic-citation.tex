Moreover, legal citation becomes even more complicated because members cite the
rules of the WTO agreement strategically. For example,
members cite different rules of the WTO agreement to limit or to encourage
the third party participation because the third party
participation can lead to early settlement of the dispute without continuous
legal battle and vice versa  \cite{who_gets}. Things are getting more interesting if we consider the fact WTO DSB defers to legal precedents to increase the predictability of its own judicial decisions.
Members reshape these legal precedents in favor of their future interest rather than simply using the WTO DSB to resolve their trade dispute with other member \citep{pelc}.
For example, members try to cite their favorable previous cases more often in specific issue areas where they face ligitagion more frequently \citep{latent}.

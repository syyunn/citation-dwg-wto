To map the regulatory system of WTO DSB with a network of legal articles of WTO agreement,
this paper introduces a novel design of deep neural network \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/Schmidhuber14} that
gets two different types of input at the same time.
One is textual description of trade policy that led to the dispute and
the other one is the content of the specific legal article of the WTO agreement.
This design is improvised to mimic
the reasoning process of the legal practitioners
where the legal practitioners read
the text description of
factual circumstances of the dispute and think about the contents of
the applicable legal articles at the same time.
To train this neural network, I collected textual description of trade policy 
that led to the dispute and articles of the WTO agreement cited for each dispute
case requested to the WTO DSB 
from 1995 to 2018.
Then I trained this neural network to answer correctly 
about whether the given article of the WTO agreement
can be cited for the given textual description of 
trade policy that led to the dispute.
After training, I collected all the answers of the trained neural network 
and created a network of legal articles of WTO agreement where 
the nodes are articles of the WTO agreement 
and edges are ranking the importance between incoming nodes for each 
target node using a tree-based ensemble machine learning method 
using the answers of the trained neural network.

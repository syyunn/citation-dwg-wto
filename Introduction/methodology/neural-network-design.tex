To train this neural network, this paper collected textual description of trade policy 
that led to the dispute and articles of the WTO agreement cited for each dispute
case requested to the WTO DSB 
from 1995 to 2018 (\hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{Total $143$ cases. \textit{Check} the list in Appendix A.2}).
Using this collected data, I trained the neural network by enforcing the neural network to answer correctly 
whether a given article of the WTO agreements
can be cited for the given textual description of 
trade policy that led to the dispute (\textit{See} Figure \ref{fig:design-of-nn} and Figure \ref{fig:def:io:nn}).
% After finish training, I collected all the predictions from the trained neural network (Figure \ref{predidction_matrix})
% and fitted a best network of legal articles of the WTO agreement
% using this collection of answers.
After training, I fitted a set of directed edge weight $W^*$ that 
best explains the variance of each article's citability predicted by the trained deep neural network using a ensemble of random forests \citep{genie3}. 

%for given $V$, $E$ % and collection of answers from the trained neural network (Figure \ref{predidction_matrix}) 
%which is widely used in the biomedical engineering to reconstruct gene regulatory networks.\footnote{Anaology of international normative system to genetics maybe natural because gene expressions (achieving main principles of WTO) are governed by complex interaction between multiple regulatory proteins (interaction between legal articles of WTO). Similar notion is adopted in \cite{gene_analogy} to explain the the evolution of norm of transparency in international security.}

To check whether this fitted network of articles of the WTO agreements $G^*$ = ($V$, $E$, $W^*$) maps the regulatory system of WTO DSB properly, this paper
compares the fitted network $G^*$ with the jurisprudence of WTO DSB made by \textit{Panel} and \textit{Appellate Body}. 
This comparison reveals that the fitted network $G^*$ captures the interaction between the articles of WTO agreements
similarly with the jurisprudence of \textit{Panel} and \textit{the Appellate Body}. This similarity guarantees that the fitted network $G^*$ closely maps the regulatory system of WTO DSB since only these two judicial bodies 
can authoritatively consitute the jurisprudence over how rules of WTO agreements are working together 
to achieve the main principles of WTO.

% Morover, this paper justifies the use of textual information inside the textual description of the dispute and legal article by showing that simply using the co-citation pattern between articles of the WTO disputes can't qualitatively fit the $G^*$ (\textit{See} Figure \ref{fig:adj} and Figure \ref{}). 
% Upon this necessity of using the textual information, this paper also justifies the use of neural network that is computationally intensive since it's generally known that proper design of neural network is able to effectively extract information from the textual content.

% Finally, I will explain how this fitting of network of legal articles can contribute to the current study of international normative system.

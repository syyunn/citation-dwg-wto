To map the regulatory system of WTO DSB as 
a network of legal articles of WTO agreement 
successfully,
this paper improvises 
a novel design of deep neural network (Figure \ref{fig:traditional-convolutional-network}) that
processes two different types of textual information.
% This deep neural network 
% processes two different types of input.
One is textual description of trade policy that led to the dispute and
the other one is the content of a legal article of the WTO agreement.
This design is improvised to mimic
the reasoning process of WTO legal practitioners
where the legal practitioners read
the text description of
factual circumstances of the dispute and think about contents of
the applicable legal articles at the same time.


To train this neural network, this paper collected textual description of trade policy 
that led to the dispute and articles of the WTO agreement cited for each dispute
case requested to the WTO DSB 
from 1995 to 2018 (\hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{Appendix A.2}).
Then I trained this neural network by enforcing the neural network to answer correctly 
about whether the given article of the WTO agreement
can be cited for the given textual description of 
trade policy that led to the dispute.

After training, I collected all the answers from trained neural network (Figure \ref{predidction_matrix})
and created a network of legal articles of the WTO agreement (Figure \ref{fig:market-aceess_directed}) from these collected answers.
This created network is identified as mapping the regulatory system of WTO DSB properly since the network 
clearly captures the current important jurisprudence of WTO DSB made by Panel and Appellate Body.

Moreover, this paper shows the clear limitation of not using the textual information 
and justifies the use of neural network to process textual information.
By doing so, this papeer contributes following points:

Ensuring the \textit{Market Access} principle 
% by enforcing
% the binding tariff to imported products, by preventing the internal regulations from discrimintating the domestic and imported products
% and by eliminating the quantitative restrictions
is a basic approach to smooth the world trade flow as explained in the previous section. %subsection \ref{emp:ma}. 
However, members are sometimes allowed to apply higher duties or to maintain a quantitative restrictions in certain circumstances, such as 
to act against low-price dumping of foreign producers, to offset the distorted competitive realtionship resulted by the illegal subsidies
or to take an emergency measure in case irrevisible injury to domestic industry is expected. Each of these examples 
are called \textit{Anti-dumping (AD)}, \textit{Countervailing Duties (CVD)} and \textit{Safeguard (SG)} respectively. These measures are recognized as 
three major types of \textit{Non-Tariff Barriers} (NTBs) %that can easily constitue illegal trade barriers
since these three measures often fail to satisfy the legal requirements of the WTO agreements and evolve into trade dispute.

The principle of \textit{reciporocity} is a general notion that regulates these three major NTBs.
This principle requires change of value of imports affected by a country's trade policy 
shall be balanced with the equal value of exports across trading partners affected \citep{bagwell1999}.
The rules of the WTO agreements, in particular the Article XXIII of GATT 1994, 
confers a right to insist its nullfied or imparied benefit that is expected under the WTO agreements and require satisfactory adjustement to the member 
who results in such nullification or impariment. Moreover, this article confers a right to retaliate if no satisfatory adjustment being fulfilled.

Therefore, Article XXIII regulates this action-reaction characteristics of \textit{AD}, \textit{CVD} and \textit{SG} to achieve the priniple of \textit{reciprocity}. % as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ntb-explained}.
For example, \textit{Panel} stated that a member can resort to Article XXIII and raise a legal claim in case another member levies unjustified antidumping duties that fails to fully explain the causual realtionship between the dumping and the material injury to the related industry in its report on \textit{New Zealand - Imports of Eletrical Transformers from Finland}\footnote{\textit{WTO official document} L/5814, adopted on 18 July 1985, pp.67-68, para.4.4.}:

\begin{displayquote}[]
    ``Panel believed that if a contracting party
    affected by the determination (of levying \textbf{anti-dumping duties}) could make a case that the importation could not in itself have the effect of
    causing material injury to the industry in question, that contracting party was entitled, under the relevant
    GATT provisions, \textbf{in particular Article XXIII}, that its representations be given sympathetic consideration
    and that eventually, \textbf{if no satisfactory adjustment was effected, it might refer the matter to the CONTRACTING
    PARTIES\footnote{It means raising a legal claim through WTO DSB}}, as had been done by Finland in the present case."
\end{displayquote}

\noindent This realtionship is captured by the $6.3\%$ weight of directed edge from Article VI to Article XXIII. This is because citing Article VI (Antidumping duties and CVD) naturally leads to the citation of Article XXIII to insist its impaired benefit and solicit the satisfactory adjustment relying on the principle of \textit{reciprocity} in WTO DSB. 
Also, other two types of mesures, \textit{Illegal Subsidy} and \textit{SG} whose legal requirements are regulated under the Article XVI and XIX respectively also heavily rely ($>$ 10\%) on the Article XXIII to solicit its impaired benefit and satisfactory adjustment based on the principle of \textit{reciprocity} in case the breach of those requirments occurs. 

% Since these three types of measures

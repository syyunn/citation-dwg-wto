        This figure demonstrates a network of articles of WTO agreements
        that cooperatively regulates \textit{Non-Tariff Barriers} (NTBs) in WTO DSB.
        Three major NTBs such as \textit{Anti-dumping (AD)}, \textit{Countervailing Duties (CVD)}
        and \textit{Safeguard (SG)} are relying on the Article XXIII to resolve its inconsistency with the principle of \textit{Reciprocity}.

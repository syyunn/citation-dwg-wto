This paper emphasizes the necessity of using textual information 
to qualitatively fit the edge weights $w^*$ for the \textit{directed weighted graph} $G^*$ that is defined in Figure \ref{fig:def}. 
One can simply consider a co-citation pattern between the articles of WTO agreements as a a regulatory system of WTO DSB, however,
it simply allocates a huge edge weight for frequently cited articles and fails to explain how articles interact to achieve main principles of WTO as exemplified in Figure \ref{fig:market-aceess_directed}.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Visualize the co-citation matrix that explains the structure \& construction of the matrix
% \end{itemize}

% This failure is mainly due to the insufficient information in co-citation matrix. Members tend to cite the articles of 
% the WTO agreements based on the complex characteristics of 
% the trade policy that led to the dispute, however, co-citation pattern 


% if a method 
% do not consider a way to encompass the information
% about the identiy of the trade policy at issue with 
% each article's regulatory content written in its own article text,
% it can only reflect how articles of WTO agreements are co-cited 
% together rather than reflecting how articles of WTO agreements 
% cooperates to regulate each charactersitic of complex trade policy that led to the dispute.

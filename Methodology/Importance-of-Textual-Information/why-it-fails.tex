This paper emphasizes the necessity of using textual information 
to qualitatively fit a set of edge weight $W$ defined in Figure \ref{fig:def}. % for the \textit{directed weighted graph} $G^*$ that is defined in Figure \ref{fig:def}. 
One can simply consider a co-citation pattern between the articles of WTO agreements as a a regulatory system of WTO DSB, however,
it simply allocates a large edge weight for frequently cited articles and fails to explain how articles interact to achieve main principles of WTO not like well exemplified in Figure \ref{fig:market-aceess_directed}.

This failure is mainly due to the insufficient information in co-citation matrix. Members tend to cite the articles of 
the WTO agreements based on the complex characteristics of 
the trade policy that led to the dispute, however, co-citation pattern omits this prior information.

To emphasize the importance of using textual information, I prepared two differeent matrices $W_{\text{co-cites}}$ and $W_{\text{text}}$ that is following the definition of \textit{edge weight matrix} $W$ in Figure \ref{fig:def}.
$W_{\text{co-cites}}$ is calculated only using the co-citation pattern between the articles of the WTO agreements as formally defined as \textit{Normalized Co-citation Matrix} in Figure \ref{fig:def-illus-normal-co-cites}. 
$W_{\text{text}}$ is the one that is fitted using the textual information and the way how it's fitted will be introduced at the following body in this section.
Two Heatmaps visualized in Figure \ref{fig:heatmap:edgeweights:compare} shows how sparse the $W_{\text{co-cites}}$ is. This sparisty indirectly refers to the insufficient information
to qualitatively map the regulatory system of WTO DSB. In contrast with it, if we fit the \textit{edge weight matrix} $W$ using the textual information, we get more dense matrix as visualized in Figure\ref{subfig:adj_dense}.

% and visualized them as a heatmap in Figure \ref{fig:heatmap:edgeweights:compare}.
% $W_{\text{co-cites}}$ is an edge weight matrix that is calculated only using the co-citation pattern between articles without textual information. 

% We can compare two weight matrices of each network that maps the regulatory system of WTO DSB as a network of articles of WTO agreements in Figure \ref{fig:sparse_dense}.

Upon this observation, this paper justifies the use a deep neural network to process information embedded in the text description of the trade policy and legal articles. This is because deep neural network is known to 
extract information from the text effectively to perform various tasks such as text classification \citep{minaee2020deep}, text summarization \citep{textsum} and text generation \citep{guo2017long}.



% This paper will compare two different results that one uses textual information using deep learning and the other one
% uses the frequency of co-citation only after explaining how deep learning works to encompass the textual information.

% if a method 
% do not consider a way to encompass the information
% about the identiy of the trade policy at issue with 
% each article's regulatory content written in its own article text,
% it can only reflect how articles of WTO agreements are co-cited 
% together rather than reflecting how articles of WTO agreements 
% cooperates to regulate each charactersitic of complex trade policy that led to the dispute.

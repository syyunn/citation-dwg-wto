This section introduces two main considerations that are taken to design the method used in this paper.
Those considerations justify the use of the deep neural network.
Then I explain the detailed structure of the deep neural network and its training schemes.
After finishing training of the neural network, I explain the process that I conducted to fit the network of articles using Random Forest.

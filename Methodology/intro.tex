This section introduces two main considerations to design the method to qualitatively fit $G^*$.
I justify the use of deep learning upon those considerations.
Then I explain the structure of the deep neural network and its training process.
After training of the deep neural network, I explain the process of fitting the network $G^*$ using \textit{Random Forest} \citep{rf, genie3}.

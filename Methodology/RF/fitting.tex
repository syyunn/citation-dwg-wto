Let $f_{\theta^*}$ represent the trained neural network with an optimized set of parameters $\theta^*$. 
Then we can construct a prediction matrix $P = (f_{\theta^*}(t_d, a_v)) \in [0,1]^{{|D| \times |V|}}$  by collecting all predictions $f_{\theta^*}(t_d, a_v)$ from the trained neural network $f_{\theta^{*}}$ using the all pairs of data $(t_d,a_v) \in T \times A$ as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:illutrate-preds}.

Upon the assumption that the trained neural network $f_{\theta^*}$ effectively encodes a shared understanding among legal experts of WTO agreements, our task is to find a set of directed edge weights $\{w_{ij} \mid w_{ij} = w(v_i, v_j) \text{ } s.t. \text{ } w(v_j, v_j) = 0 \text{ and } \sum_{v_i\in V}{w(v_i, v_j)} = 1 \text{ } \forall v_j \}$ %W^* = w(v_i, v_j)$ where
as defined in Figure \ref{fig:def}. % for given target node $v_j$ 
This set of directed edge weights $W$ represents a set of conditional praobability as conditional probability $P(v_j|v_i)$ how probably a source node $v_i$ clarifies the meaning of the target node $v_j$ compared to other source nodes as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:def-example}.

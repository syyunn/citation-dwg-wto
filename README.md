# citation-dwg-wto
LaTex work to summarize how to recover citation directed weighted graph formulated by the state &amp; legal actors participating in the WTO.

<!-- ## Rules-of-Writing-Sample
- Every single line should be interesting enough to let readers expect next line.

## ToDos
- [ ] Add Legend to Co-citation & Pred Figure (colorbar)
- [ ] Draft out the Subsystem with w/o Edges 
- [ ] Details out the Subsystem with w/ Edges (e.g. "Hypothetical Test")
- [ ] Measure the Outdegree to explain the Importance with SIZE (as a visual cue)
- [ ] Clarify the edge-directve: For A->B, A is required to Clarify the Meaning of the B.
- [ ] Highlight Important Node w/ Colored border
- [ ] Add Captions to Market Access

 ## ToDos

 - [ ] Clarify the following with neural network diagram

    To train this neural network, this paper collected textual description of trade policy 
    that led to the dispute and articles of the WTO agreement cited for each dispute
    case requested to the WTO DSB 
    from 1995 to 2018 (\hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{Total $143$ cases. \textit{Check} the list in Appendix A.2}).
    Using this collected data, I trained the neural network by enforcing the neural network to answer correctly 
    whether a given article of the WTO agreements
    can be cited for the given textual description of 
    trade policy that led to the dispute.

- [ ] Add calculated graph entropy to spare & dense weight matrix

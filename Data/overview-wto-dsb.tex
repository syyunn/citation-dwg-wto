Members who raise the claim (preferably called \textit{complainant} in WTO DSB) usually cite multiple articles of the WTO agreements. This is to cover the complex characteristics of a trade policy that led to the dispute.
% As explained in the introduction,
% a trade policy that led to a dispute (preferably called as \textit{Government Measure} in WTO DSB) is pretty much complicated as explicitly expressed by the Panel in Figure \ref{fig:complex-measure}.
% To address this complexity,
% members who raise the claim (preferably called \textit{complainant} in WTO DSB) usually cite multiple articles of the WTO agreements at the same time. 
For example, in the
\textit{US - Offset} case,
a group of complainants\footnote{Australia,
   Brazil,
   Chile,
   European Communities,
   India,
   Indonesia,
   Japan,
   Korea and Thailand}
cited articles as shown in Table \ref{xltabular:cited-article-for-us-offset} from the WTO agreements to claim inconsistencies of \textit{Continued Dumping and Subsidy Act of 2000} (CDSOA) of the United States to those cited articles\footnote{It is worth noting that the WTO agreements comprise many different agreements covering each specific topic in trade such as \textit{Agreement on Anti-dumping, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Agreement on Agriculture} and so on.}.

Upon this understanding of multiple citations,
I collected two different types of data. %for 143 different disputes requested to the WTO DSB\footnote{\textit{Listed} case numbers at \hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{Appendix A.2}.}. 
One is textual description of the dispute\footnote{\hyperref[sub:factual-aspect-example]{\textit{Check} the CDSOA example at Appendix A.1}} and the other one is
set of articles of the WTO agreements that are
cited for each dispute\footnote{\hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{\textit{See} Appendix A.3}}.
I will explain each type of data in the following subsections in detail.
% I will explain the data source, structure, and collection method for two different types of data at the following subsections.\\

As explained in the introduction,
a trade policy that led to a dispute (preferably called as \textit{Government Measure} in WTO DSB) is pretty much complicated as explictly expressed by the Panel in Figure \ref{fig:complex-measure}.
To address this complexity,
members who raise the claim (preferably called \textit{complainant} in WTO DSB) usually cite multiple articles of the WTO agreements at the same time. For example, in the
\textit{US - Offset} case,
a group of complainants\footnotetext{Australia,
    Brazil,
    Chile,
    European Communities,
    India,
    Indonesia,
    Japan,
    Korea and Thailand}
cited articles as shown in Table \ref{xltabular:cited-article-for-us-offset} from the WTO agreements to claim its inconsitencies of \textit{Continued Dumping and Subsidy Act of 2000} (CDSOA) to those cited articles\footnote{It is worth noting that the WTO agreements comprises many different agreements covering each specific topic in trade such as \textit{Agreement on Anti-dumping, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Agreement on Agriculture} and so on.}:

        Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization & XVI:4                               \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Cited articles in \textit{US - Offset (Byrd Amendment)} by complainants}

\end{table}

\noindent Upon this understanding,
I collected two different types of data for 143 different dispute cases requested to WTO DSB. (List of cases is
available at \hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{Appendix A.2}).
One is textual description of the dispute \hyperref[sub:factual-aspect-example]{(\textit{Check} the CDSOA example at Appendix A.1)} and the other one is
set of articles of the WTO agreements that are
cited for each dispute \hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{(Appendix A.3)}.
I will explain the data source, structure and collection method for two different types of data at the following subsections.\\

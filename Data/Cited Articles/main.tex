Every lawsuit in WTO DSB 
has its own set of aritcles cited by complainant(s)
as shown in Table 
\ref{xltabular:cited-article-for-us-offset}. 
I wrote a program that collects a set of articles cited for 
each case from WTO official webpage\footnote{\url{https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_status_e.htm}}. 
The webpage chronologically lists up all dispute cases
requested to WTO DSB and the prgoram visits each dispute page of 143 cases
and collects cited articles for each case. Among all the articles from different agreements
of the WTO agreements\footnote{
    WTO agreeemnts is comprised of mutiple agreements such as
    General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994,
    Agreement on Agriculture,
    Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures,
    Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,
    Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade,
    Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures,
    Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (antidumping),
    Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures,
    Agreement on Rules of Origin,
    Agreement on Safeguards and so on.
    } ,
this paper collected articles from General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) only. 
This is because articles in GATT 1994 constitutes basic set of trade rules of WTO and other agreements 
elaborates the articles of GATT 1994 more in detail \citep{world1999wto}. For example, the official name of \textit{Agreement on Anti-dumping}
is \textit{Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994}
where the name itself explians its relationship to GATT 1994.
The collected result is listed in the \hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{Appendix A.2} and Figure \ref{fig:set-of-articles-used} 
lists distinct 80 articles of GATT 1994 cited in 143 cases without duplication.

\subsubsection{Various Levels of Scope in Cited Articles}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:set-of-articles-used}, 
members sometimes
cite articles in different levels of scope. For example, 
For the Article VI, member sometimes cites
Article VI as a whole but sometimes cites
Article VI:2 or Article VI:2(a).
This is because two main judicial bodies of WTO DSB, Panel and Appellate Body, 
both constitutes its jurisprudence using
various level of scope to interpret the legal texts of the WTO agreements,
such as in the level of \textit{Title, Article, Paragraph, Sentence or Term} as shown in Table {\ref{xltabular:level-of-scopes}}. 
Following this jurisprudence, members also cite articles in different levels of scope to 
make their legal claim valid as much as possible.

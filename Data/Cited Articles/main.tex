Every legal claim in WTO DSB
cites multiple set of articles
as shown in Table
\ref{xltabular:cited-article-for-us-offset}.
To collect this set of articles claimed for each dispute, I wrote a program that collects this set of articles cited from the WTO official webpage\footnote{\url{https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_status_e.htm}}.
The webpage chronologically lists up all dispute cases
requested to WTO DSB and the program visits each page
and collects the cited articles. Among all the agreements included in the WTO agreements\footnote{
   WTO agreements is comprised of multiple agreements, such as
   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994,
   Agreement on Agriculture,
   Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures,
   Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,
   Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade,
   Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures,
   Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (antidumping),
   Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures,
   Agreement on Rules of Origin,
   Agreement on Safeguards and so on.
   },
this paper collected articles from the \textit{General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994} (GATT 1994) only.
This is because articles in GATT 1994 constitutes basic set of trade rules of WTO and other agreements
elaborates the articles of GATT 1994 more in detail \citep{world1999wto}. For example, the official name of \textit{Agreement on Anti-dumping}
is \textit{Agreement on Implementation of \textbf{Article VI of the GATT 1994}}
where the name self-explains that it elaborates on the article VI of GATT 1994.
The collected result is listed in the \hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{Appendix A.2}. Figure \ref{fig:set-of-articles-used}
lists up 80 different articles of GATT 1994 cited in 143 cases without duplication.

\subsubsection{Various Levels of Scope in Cited Articles}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:set-of-articles-used},
members sometimes
cite articles in different levels of scope. For example,
For the Article II, member sometimes cites
Article II as a whole but sometimes cites
Article II:1 or Article II:1(a).
This is because two main judicial bodies of WTO DSB, Panel and Appellate Body,
both constitute its legal precedents citing articles of the WTO agreements in
various levels of scope.
The various levels of scopes include, \textit{Title, Article, Paragraph, Sentence} or \textit{Term} as shown in  \hyperref[xltabular:level-of-scopes]{Appendix A.3}.
Following this practice, members also cite articles in different levels of scope to
make their legal claim fit and valid according to the general jurisprudence of WTO DSB.\\ %as much as possible.\\

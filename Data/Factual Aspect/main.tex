Textual description of the dispute is preferably called as
\textit{Factual Aspect} in WTO DSB.
Since Panels
always provide a factual aspect\footnote{
   It's worth noting that Appellate Body doesn't provide any factual aspect because they always use the factual aspect provided by the Panel.
}
that summarizes the content of the dispute
in the panel report, %(Figure \ref{fig:panel-report-toc}),
I wrote a program that can
automatically search and collect
the panel reports from the WTO official document website\footnote{
   \url{http://docs.wto.org}
}.
Then I located the factual aspect using the page information inside the
table of contents in the panel report as shown in Figure \ref{fig:panel-report-toc}.
By using this location, I excerpted 143 numbers of different factual aspects from the same number of different panel reports. The case numbers are listed in Figure \ref{fig:ds-cases-used}.
 
\subsubsection{Joint Adjudication \& Early Settlement}
 
The number 143 seems small compared to the total 596\footnote
{As of November 1st, 2020.} number of cases that are requested to WTO DSB. This is due to the following two reasons.
 
First, panel handles different cases together if the case is about the
same trade policy. For example, in \textit{US - Offset (Byrd Amendment)}, panel merged DS217\footnote{
   DS refers to \textit{Dispute Settelement}. DS is official prefix that indicates the case in WTO DSB.
} and DS234 together because they were asking the judicial opinion for the same government measure of the United States as shown in Figure \ref{fig:linked-cases}.
This paper selects the smallest case number as a representative number for this case of joint adjudication.
For example, DS217 and DS234 shares the same panel report then this paper chooses DS217 as a representative number as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ds-cases-used} where the list includes DS217 but not DS234.
 
Second, members sometimes find \textit{mutually agreeable solution} before the panel expresses its judicial opinion by publishing its panel report. Then Panel stops there and no factual aspect is provided. This paper omitted this kind of \textit{early settled} cases as well.

Textual description of trade policy that 
led to the dispute is formally called 
\textit{Factual Aspect} in WTO DSB. 
Since panels
always provide a factual aspect
that summarizes the content of the dispute
in the panel report (Figure \ref{fig:panel-report-toc}),
this paper wrote a program that can 
automatically search and collect 
the panel reports in the WTO official doucment website\footnote{
    \url{http://docs.wto.org}
}.
Then I wrote another program that locates the start 
and end page of the factual asepct using the information in the 
table of contents of the report (Figure \ref{fig:panel-report-toc}).
By using this location, I excerpted factual aspect 
from the panel reports. 
\hyperref[sub:factual-aspect-example]{Appendix A.1} shows an
example of excerpted factual aspect.

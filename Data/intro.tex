As explained in the introduction,
a trade policy that led to a dispute (formally called as \textit{Government Measure}) is pretty much complicated.
For example, the Panel for the \textit{US - Offset (Byrd Amendment)} explains:

\noindent To address this complexity, 
members who raise the claim (formally called \textit{complainant}) usually cite multiple articles of the WTO agreements. For example, in the
\textit{US - Offset (Byrd Amendment)} case,
a group of complainants\footnote{Australia,
    Brazil,
    Chile,
    European Communities,
    India,
    Indonesia,
    Japan,
    Korea and Thailand}
cited articles as shown in Table \ref{xltabular:cited-article-for-us-offset} from the WTO agreements to claim possible inconsitency of CDSOA to these articles\footnote{It is worth noting that the WTO agreements comprises many different agreements covering each specific topic in trade such as \textit{Agreement on Anti-dumping, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures} and so on.}:\\

\noindent Upon this understanding, 
I collected two different types of data for 143 different dispute cases requested to WTO DSB.\footnote{List of collected cases is
    available at \hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{Appendix A.2}
}.
One is textual description of trade policy
that led to the dispute \hyperref[sub:factual-aspect-example]{(\textit{See} an example at Appendix A.2)} and the other one is
set of articles of the WTO agreements that are
cited for each dispute \hyperref[sub:cited-articles-table]{(Appendix A.3)}.
I will explain the format and the content of
data with an example at the following subsections.

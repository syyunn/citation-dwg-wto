I collected two different types of data for 143 dispute cases 
requested to the WTO DSB.
One is textual description of trade policy 
that led to the dispute \hyperref[sub:factual-aspect-example]{(Appendix A.2)} and the other one is 
set of articles of the WTO agreement that are
cited for each dispute. 
I will explain the format and the content of 
each type of data with an example. 
Technical details about the automated way 
of collecting and cleansing the data is 
explained in the \hyperref[sec:appendix]{Appendix}.
